# GWJ Topic List Previews

Theme Component which allows you to customise the layout for many of the Topic Lists across Discourse, fundamentally adding thumbnail previews and excerpts from Topics, a featured topics images banner and a user portfolio (aka user wall). It now includes both masonry-style tiles and a uniform grid layout for topic cards.

Add to the functionality by also installing the sidecar at: https://github.com/merefield/discourse-topic-previews-sidecar
